# Registration Form with Node.js and MongoDB

This project is a simple registration form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, and Node.js with Express.js and MongoDB for the back-end. It allows users to sign up by entering their username, email, and password. The user information is then stored in a MongoDB database.
